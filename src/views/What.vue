      <h1> What is this??? </h1>
      <p>
          Ever get annoyed at how social media gives a voice to the most click-baity idiots?
      </p>
      <p>
          Trending tweets, youtube videos, and reddit posts - all brought before you by the unassuming clicks of the masses
          and the mindless algorithms of corporations...
      </p>
      <p>
          So what's the solution?
      </p>
      <p>
          Pure. Randomness.
      </p>
      <p>
          The most fair way of choosing who has a voice out of the boundless amounts of content on the internet is
          obviously to just pull a name out of a hat. So that's what we do.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once a day you can submit an entry - Whether it's pwning the libs, explaining your sigma grindset, or... normal things.
          Then, at midnight New York time, a random entry from the last 24 hours gets posted on the home page. Voila!
      </p>

          Enjoy the blissful feeling of equality! - Max
